    "Description": "There is no many-to-many relationship in the current schema. Although we want to keep this schema as simple as possible, we still want to provide at least one many-to-many relationship.\n\nSuggestion: Create a new entity Playlist which has a many-to-many relationship with the Track entity. This will result in two new tables: Playlist and PlaylistTrack tables.",
